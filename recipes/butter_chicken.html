    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Butter chicken</strong>, or murgh makhani, is a <em>rich and creamy</em> Indian dish featuring <em>tender chicken simmered in a velvety tomato-based sauce</em>. The chicken is typically marinated in yogurt and spices, then grilled or pan-seared before being added to a luscious sauce made with tomatoes, butter, cream, and aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, and fenugreek. The result is a perfectly balanced dish that is mildly spiced, slightly tangy, and deeply flavorful.</p>
    <p>Served with fluffy basmati rice or warm naan, butter chicken is a comforting and indulgent meal. The sauceâ€™s smooth texture and buttery richness complement the juicy, spiced chicken, making it one of the most popular Indian dishes worldwide. Its creamy, mildly sweet taste appeals to a wide range of palates, making it a go-to for anyone exploring Indian cuisine.</p>
