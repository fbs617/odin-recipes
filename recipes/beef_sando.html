    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A <strong>Japanese beef sando</strong>, or Wagyu katsu sando, is a luxurious sandwich featuring <em>a crispy, breaded beef cutlet encased in soft, pillowy Japanese milk bread</em>. The beef, often high-quality Wagyu or another tender cut, is lightly seasoned, coated in flour, egg, and panko, then deep-fried to a perfect golden crisp while remaining juicy inside. The cutlet is then nestled between slices of toasted shokupan, spread with butter, Japanese mustard, and a rich, slightly tangy tonkatsu sauce that enhances the umami flavors.</p>
    <p>The sandwich is traditionally served crustless, cut into neat halves or thirds, allowing the contrast of crispy beef and fluffy bread to shine. Its balance of textures and flavors—crunchy, juicy, buttery, and slightly sweet—makes it a simple yet indulgent treat. Best enjoyed fresh, the beef sando is a staple in high-end Japanese cafés and a favorite among those who appreciate the delicate balance of high-quality ingredients prepared with precision.</p>
