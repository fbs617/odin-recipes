    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A <strong>California roll</strong> is a popular sushi roll known for its <em>refreshing and slightly creamy flavor</em>. It features sushi rice wrapped around imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber, often with a thin sheet of nori inside. Unlike traditional sushi rolls, the rice is on the outside, sometimes coated with sesame seeds or tobiko for added texture and flavor. The combination of sweet, savory, and creamy ingredients makes it a great introduction to sushi, especially for those who prefer a milder taste.</p>
    <p>This roll became famous for its Western-friendly ingredients and absence of raw fish, making it an accessible option for sushi beginners. Its balance of creamy avocado, crisp cucumber, and slightly sweet crab filling creates a light yet satisfying bite. Often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, the California roll remains a staple in sushi restaurants worldwide.</p>
